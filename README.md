# A Friendly Little Bot

Packed with fun features like challenging your friends to a friendly match of tic tac toe, A Friendly Little Bot is ideal for spicing up your monotonous servers.

To build and run the source code yourself, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. The file should contain the following:

```
TOKEN=<Bot Token>
CLIENT_ID=<The Bot's Discord ID>
DEV_GUILD_ID=<Testing Server's ID> Note that this is optional
MONGODB_URL=<URL to MongoDB database>
```

Or alternatively, invite the bot to your server by clicking on the following [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=842744783742566411&permissions=414464724032&scope=bot%20applications.commands)!
