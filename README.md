# A Friendly Little Bot

Packed with fun features like challenging your friends to a friendly match of tic tac toe, A Friendly Little Bot is ideal for spicing up your monotonous servers.

To build and run the source code yourself, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. The file should contain the following:

```
TOKEN=<Bot Token>
CLIENT_ID=<The Bot's Discord ID>
DEV_GUILD_ID=<Testing Server's ID> Note that this is optional
MONGODB_URL=<URL to MongoDB database>
```
